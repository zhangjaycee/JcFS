# JcFS

I'm trying to write my first toy File System, that's exicting but not easy for me ... JcFS has no specific features yet (233333..)

JcFS will be built on top of:

* FUSE and libfuse -- Filesystem in Userspace

Details: https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse

* LZ4 -- A very fast compression algorithm

Details: https://github.com/lz4/lz4
